| 2    | 不起眼的瓶子   | Put a lit candle behind abottle. If you blow on the bottle  from the opposite side, the candle may goout, as if the bottle was not there  at all. Explain the phenomenon. |
| 3    | 声管           | A Sound Tube is a  toy,consisting of a corrugated plastic tube, that you can spin around to  producesounds. Study the characteristics of the sounds produced by such toys,  and howthey are affected by the relevant parameters. |
| 4    | “歌神”铁氧体   | Insert a ferrite rod  intoa coil fed from a signal generator. At some frequencies the rod begins  toproduce a sound. Investigate the phenomenon. |
| 7    | 绳子上的球     | Put a string through  aball with a hole in it such that the ball can move freely along the string.  Attachanother ball to one end of the string. When you move the free end  periodically,you can observe complex movements of the two balls. Investigate  the phenomenon. |
| 8    | 肥皂膜过滤器   | A heavy particle may  fallthrough a horizontal soap film without rupturing it. However, a light  particlemay not penetrate the film and may remain on its surface. Investigate  theproperties of such a membrane filter. |
| 10   | 画出来的导线   | A line drawn with  apencil on paper can be electrically conducting. Investigate the  characteristicsof the conducting line. |
| 12   | 多边形涡流     | A stationary  cylindricalvessel containing a rotating plate near the bottle surface is  partially filledwith liquid. Under certain conditions, the shape of the  liquid surface becomespolygon-like. Explain this phenomenon and investigate  the dependence on therelevant parameters. |
| 13   | 摩擦振子       | A massive object  isplaced onto two identical parallel horizontal cylinders. The two cylinders  eachrotate with the same angular velocity, but in opposite directions.  Investigatehow the motion of the object on the cylinders depends on the  relevantparameters. |
| 14   | 下落的塔       | Identical discs  arestacked one on top of another to form a freestanding tower. The bottom  disc canbe removed by applying a sudden horizontal force such that the rest  of thetower will drop down onto the surface and the tower remains  standing.Investigate the phenomenon and determine the conditions that allow  the tower toremain standing. |
| 15   | 胡椒罐         | If you take a salt  orpepper pot and just shake it, the contents will pour out relatively  slowly.However, if an object is rubbed along the bottom of the pot, then the  rate ofpouring can increase dramatically. Explain this phenomenon and  investigate howthe rate depends on the relevant parameters. |
| 16   | 镍钛合金发动机 | Place a nitinol wire  looparound two pulleys with their axes located at some distance from each  other. Ifone of the pulleys is immersed into hot water, the wire tends to  straighten,causing a rotation of the pulleys. Investigate the properties of  such anengine. |
| 17   | 玩纸牌         | A standard playing  cardcan travel a very long distance provided that spin is imparted as it is  thrown.Investigate the parameters that affect the distance and the trajectory |
